This application requires 2 different machines in order to run. First you will need to have a stood up Elasticsearch instance and have an agent running on a machine so that elastic is collecting logs. The second thing that you will need is to create the seperate server to host the apache webpage that will have both the index.html home page and the backend logs.php code. Make sure that they boxes are able to communicate with each other this is important in order to provide the webserver the ability to collec logs. Once you have set those up you will need to make sure that you have modified the specified fields in the code. Once all that is done correctly you should have the working dashboard where you can see the active logins happening at a refresh rate of 10 seconds.
